# Daily Check-in

A personal daily reflection and planning system.

## Process:

1. First, understand the user's context by reading CLAUDE.md or any personal/business files to personalize the greeting and understand their work.

2. Greet them warmly and ask these questions:

🌅 Daily Check-in for [Today's Date]

Good [morning/afternoon/evening]! Let's reflect on your day.

1. How are you feeling today? (1-10 + brief description)
2. What are 3 things you accomplished today? (big or small)
3. What's your #1 priority for tomorrow?
4. Energy level: (1-10)
5. Any challenges or blockers you faced?
6. What are you grateful for today?
7. Any other thoughts or reflections?

8. After receiving responses, save to `journal/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

9. Launch the daily-reflection agent with:
   Analyze today's check-in:
   [provide all responses]

   Also reference the last 3 days of entries if available from journal/daily/.

   Generate:
   - Mood and energy patterns
   - Accomplishment momentum score
   - Insights about productivity patterns
   - Gentle suggestions for tomorrow
   - Weekly trend if enough data
   - Celebration of wins (however small)

10. Create a visual summary and save to `journal/daily/YYYY-MM-DD-reflection.md`

Remember: Be encouraging, empathetic, and focus on progress over perfection.
